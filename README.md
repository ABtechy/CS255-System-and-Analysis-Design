DriverPass System Design Portfolio Summary

**Project Overview**

The DriverPass project focused on designing a system for a small driving school that sought to modernize how it manages students, instructors, lessons, and practice tests. The client, DriverPass, needed a web‑based system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, take online practice exams, track their progress, and communicate with instructors. They also needed administrative tools for managing packages, availability, and reporting.

**What went well**

WHat went really well for me was translating the client’s needs into clear, structured system requirements and diagrams. My use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams were consistent and aligned with the interview transcript. My focus was on making them easy to understand for both technical and non‑technical audiences. I also kept my documentation organized and practical, which helped create a strong foundation for how the system would function.

**What I Would Change**

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the class diagram. While it accurately represented the system, I would improve it by adding more detail around relationships, constraints, and data types to make it more useful for developers during implementation. Strengthening that diagram would make the transition from design to development even smoother.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the interview transcript and identifying the tasks each user group needed to perform—students, instructors, the owner, the secretary, and the IT administrator. I then mapped those needs into functional requirements, workflows, and system interactions. Considering user needs is essential because a system only succeeds if it supports real‑world tasks in a way that feels reliable. Designing with the user in mind reduces confusion, prevents errors, and ensures the system actually solves the problems it was created for.

**My Approach to Software Design**

When designing software, I start by understanding the problem from the user’s perspective and breaking it down into clear requirements. I rely on techniques like use case modeling, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams to visualize how the system should behave. In the future, I plan to continue using structured analysis, iterative refinement, and user‑centered design strategies. These approaches help ensure that the final system is both functional and easy to maintain, and that it aligns with the goals of the client and the needs of the end users.
